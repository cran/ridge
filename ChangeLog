	* Bug fix in src/commonFunctions.c

2012-8-21   Erika Cule <erika.cule05@imperial.ac.uk>

	* Added configure.ac so that package will install if GSL >= 1.14 is not available 
	(with linearRidgeGenotypes, logisticRidgeGenotypes, linearRidgeGenotypesPredict and 
	logisticRidgeGenotypesPredict disabled). 
	* configure.ac detects whether openblas is available and if it is found, links to that. 
	This speeds up computation. (http://xianyi.github.com/OpenBLAS/)

	Major new release
	* fixed a bug in linearRidge when scaling = "none"
	* added functions linearRidgeGenotypes and logisticRidgeGenotypes and their predicting counterparts linearRidgeGenotypesPredict and 
	logisticRidgeGenotypespredict. These functions fit linear and logistic ridge regression models for genome-wide SNP data, 
	optionally automatically choosing the ridge parameter
	* minor bug fix: "Intercept" now prints as "(Intercept)"
		(as is the case for lm and glm models)
