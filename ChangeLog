	Major new release
	* fixed a bug in linearRidge when scaling = "none"
	* added functions linearRidgeGenotypes and logisticRidgeGenotypes and their predicting counterparts linearRidgeGenotypesPredict and 
	logisticRidgeGenotypespredict. These functions fit linear and logistic ridge regression models for genome-wide SNP data, 
	optionally automatically choosing the ridge parameter
	* minor bug fix: "Intercept" now prints as "(Intercept)"
		(as is the case for lm and glm models)
